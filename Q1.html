      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          The Doctor of Philosophy degree in Computer Science (PhD-CS) program's
          main goal is to provide advanced knowledge in the field of computer
          science with in-depth research experience. The program will offer a
          comprehensive list of courses based on the core of computer science,
          research, and optimization methodologies concentrated on advanced
          development in computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Candidates admitted to the program are expected to have completed a
          master's degree in computer science or a closely related field. For
          the award of PhD-CS degree, candidates are required to successfully
          finish the course work, pass a comprehensive exam, and complete a
          research-based dissertation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The PhD-CS program emphasizes proficiency in understanding fundamental
          and advanced topics in computer science, communicating learned
          knowledge with excellent oral and written skills, and taking the lead
          in research and development in chosen field of expertise. The
          candidates should demonstrate their ability to engage independently in
          state-of-the-art research and provide original and significant
          contribution in their area of specialization.
